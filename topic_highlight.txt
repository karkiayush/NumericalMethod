Root: those value which on subtituting on the equation satisfies that equation.
y=f(x) is parallel or overlapping to x axis.

BISECTION METHOD
Assumptions:
a. f(x) is continuous on [a,b]
b. f(a).f(b)<0				

Algorithm:
step1: Define function f(x)
step2: Define Error E
step3: Choose a<b such that f(a)*f(b)<0. If it satisfies, the root of equation lies between a and b.
step4: use formula x=(a+b)/2
step5: compute f(x)
step6: if f(x)<E, then root is x, 
		else
		check if f(a)*f(b)<b
			if true, put b=x 
			else a=x
		    Goto step 4. 
step7: end
